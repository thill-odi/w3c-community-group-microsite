# 2018-02-27 - Booking: Overview and direction check

## Summary

We ran through the booking specification at a high level, including checking the direction taken on remaining issues. Everyone was broadly happy, with some comments to raise on GitHub and a suggestion to consolidate cancellations into a single PUT call for the Order \(to allow for atomic cancellation, given the potential for additional cancellation constraints to exist\).
